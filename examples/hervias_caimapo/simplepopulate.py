ACT Targeted Transient Flux Constraints from Hervías-Caimapo et al. 2023

This data release provides full tables of flux density upper limits for
individual targeted transients as observed by ACT, presented in Hervías-Caimapo
et al. (2023). The tables include multiple time ranges before and after the
discovery of the transient, in the f090, f150, f220 frequency channels of ACT
when available. Samples of the content of the tables are shown in the paper,
while this release includes all the individual transients.

During the peer review process, we discovered two mistakes that impact the flux
calculation: we did not deconvolve the pixel window function from maps and the
spectral correction for beams was executed with the wrong procedure. However,
the effect is minimal, of only a few percent in the flux estimation. In February
2024 the tables were updated correcting for these.

### Tables

There are three tables: table_SNe.txt corresponds to SNe and Astronomical
Transients (ATs), table_TDEs.txt corresponds to TDEs, and table_GRBs corresponds
to GRBs. All the flux density upper limits are in units of mJy.
