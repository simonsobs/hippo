"""
The caching layer for sources used by the SOPO client.

A cache is:

a) A directory on your filesystem
b) A set of files in that directory
c) A SQLite database that stores metadata about the files
   that are being cached.

Because marshalling is so simple here we do not use
SQLAlchemy or any other ORM. We just use the built-in
Python sqlite3 module.

class Cache:
    """
    A cache for sources used by the SOPO client. All sources are labelled by their
    unique ID, given by the main mongodb database.

    The general execution flow when using a (set of) cache(s) is:

    1. Check if the file is in the cache with ``available``. If it is, you will be
       immediately given the on-disk path to the file. If not, we will raise a
       FileNotFoundError.
    2. Check the other caches if it is not available.
    3. Attain a pre-signed URL for your source.
    4. Fetch the source from the pre-signed URL with your preferred cache with ``get``.
       This will return you an on-disk path to the downloaded source within your cache
       area. You can check which caches are writeable with ``writeable``.

    So for a list of caches, you would do something like:

    .. code-block::python

        MY_FILE_ID = "123456789012345678901234"
